History
Goerli Testnet was the first proof-of-authority cross-client testnet, synching Geth, Nethermind, Hyperledger Besu, and others. This testnet was a community-based project and completely open-source. It was born in September 2018 during ETHBerlin and has been growing in contributors ever since.

The Goerli testnet was merged with the Prater proof-of-stake beacon chain. This marked the end of the permissioned proof-of-authority phase and everyone is now able to run a validator for Goerli. Therefore, this repository contains both Goerli execution-layer and Prater consensus-layer configurations.
